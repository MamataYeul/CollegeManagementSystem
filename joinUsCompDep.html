                     The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) is well known as one of India's premier engineering institutes, which has produced highly successful researchers and entrepreneurs. IIT Bombay has among the brightest engineering/science students in the country.  We take pride in our active and vibrant academic research environment.  The Department of CSE (IITB) has not only the largest set of CSE faculty (see faculty list here), but also among the best research minds in almost every area of Computer Science. We provide a nurturing, friendly, and flexible environment for faculty to develop their academic research careers.  And last but not least, the quality of living on IIT Bombay campus is invaluable in many ways.

                 The CSE department and the institute, offer an environment conducive to research, e.g.<br>
               </p>
               <ol>
                 <li>
             Easily manageable teaching load (1 course per semester) and availability of teaching assistants.
                 </li>
                 <li>
             The opportunity to join existing labs and centers (see, for example <a href="http://www.cfdvs.iitb.ac.in/">CFDVS Lab</a>) with
             established research programs, as well as the opportunity to build your own infrastructure and associated research program in the <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/page13">Graduate Research Labs.</a>
                 </li>
                 <li>
             A substantial "seed" grant is given to new faculty, to jump-start their research program.
                 </li>
                 <li>
             Funding for travel to international conferences.
                 </li>
                 <li>
             An excellent central library, with a generous book allowance to the department, and subscription to all major on-line technical
             resources.
                 </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                 In addition to this, it is possible to raise grant money for research through various government and industry sources.&nbsp;
               </p> 
               <ol>
                 <li>Government agencies invite proposals all year round, and are generally keen to grant funding in various thrust areas.</li>
                 <li>Mumbai(Bombay) is home to big corporate houses in the information technology space (e.g., Tata) which continue to fund large projects at IIT
             Bombay. <!--(see <a href="/laiir/">LAIIR</a>)--><br>
                 </li>
                 <li>Several Bangalore and Pune based technology companies fund exciting research projects at IIT Bombay (see <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/page19">Funded Projects</a>).  IIT Bombay's most significant
             advantage in this respect is, again, it's location - Mumbai is very well-connected to Bangalore and Pune.<br></li>

               <div class="collapsible-body content"><span>
                   <p>IIT Bombay has significantly increased its focus on graduate programs, in addition to regularly being the most-sought destination for undergraduate students. Some points worth noting are:
       
               </p>
               <ol>
               <li>CSE, IIT Bombay now has more students per graduate batch than per undergraduate batch. </li>
                 <li>All graduate students admitted through the main selection process are guranteed teaching assistantships for the entire duration of
           their programmes here, including summers (two years for M.Tech. and four years for Ph.D.).</li>
           <li>Increase in incentives for joining the Ph.D. programme, such as well-paying fellowships and funding for conference travel, has
               resulted in attracting more Ph.D. students to the department.</li>
                 <li>The M.Tech degree (M. Tech.) is a two-year program with the second year almost entirely devoted to the Masters thesis work.  We also have a three-year M.Tech program where students can contribute to R&D over an extended period.
                 </li>
                 <li>Recently, the Computer Science department started offering a "Dual Degree", which allows a student to work for almost two and half years on a project - enough time to do some significant research.
                 </li>
                
               </ol>
               <br/>
                 </span>

                   <h5>Faculty Benefits</h5>
                 </div>
                 <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                     <p>
                 Faculty enjoy several personal benefits, for example<br>
               </p>
               <ol>
                 <li>A beautiful residential campus, with top-notch sporting facilities.
                   </li>
                 <li>On-campus housing and free high-speed LAN connection at home.</li>
                 <li>There are two schools within campus, Kendriya Vidyalaya (Central School) as well as the Campus School, to which faculty can admit their children.  There are also several other good quality schools in the vicinity of the campus.
                   </li>
                 <li>On-campus free or subsidized medical care for faculty and their dependents.</li>
                 
                 <li>Consulting: Faculty are allowed to earn additional personal income by offering their expert services to industry clients. IIT
             Bombay's <a href="http://www.ircc.iitb.ac.in/">IRCC</a> (Industrial Research and Consultancy Centre) facilitates this
             activity.<br></li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                 <i> Benefits are subject to availability and other conditions. The above reflects typical benefits enjoyed by most faculty members.
             However, all final decisions are made by the corresponding authorities. </i> <p/>

                 <h5>Quality of Life on IIT Bombay Campus</h5>
               </div>
               <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p> Living on the IIT Bombay campus offers an absolutely unbeatable combination of opportunities - that of living in a city that is the financial, business, and entertainment hub of India, while still enjoying the peace and quiet of a lush green campus nestled between a lake and rolling hills. The campus has all amenities needed for a high quality of living - green, tree-filled and pollution-free surroundings, children's park, swimming pool and various sports facilities: tennis, badminton, squash, volley-ball, basket-ball, hockey, cricket, football, etc. There is an on-campus creche (day-care centre), and two schools.
               </p>
               <img align="left" src="../images/children_park-small.jpg"  hspace=10 vspace=5 alt="Children&quot;s Park">
               
               <p>
                 The campus is vibrant with student-led cultural activities throughout the year. Faculty gets free, premium seating at professional performances during the main cultural festival (Mood Indigo), as well as at the enthralling Performance Arts Functions (student performances). There are additional cultural events (music, dance, theater, movies) throughout the year in the various campus auditoriums.
                 <br/><br/> The campus community is a warm, friendly community of IIT Bombay faculty, staff and students that comes together for events such as Holi and Diwali. The CSE department itself has informal get-togethers, such as faculty picnics and dinners, and faculty-student cricket matches.
       
               </p>
               <p>
                 <img align="right" src="../images/nature0019-small.jpg" hspace=8 vspace=5 alt="" style="height:200px;">
                 If you do step out of the campus, the most energetic city of India invites you to explore it. Local transportation in Mumbai is "legendary", and an impressive network of buses and trains takes you to every corner of the city. IIT Bombay is a 45-minute train ride away from various interesting downtown areas which make for fun day trips. Trekking in the nearby Sahyadris is also a favourite weekend activity of Mumbai-ites (and IITB students) and faculty have several opportunities of joining the students on such treks.
                 <br><br>
                 Additionally, if you have family somewhere else in India, there is no city as well connected to the rest of country as Mumbai. Lastly, international travel is convenient since all major international airlines have daily flights in and out of Mumbai.
